  Turing Machine Simulator

It's a Turing Machine simulator written in javascript.
Heavily under development.

The project uses submodules, so the correct method to check out is:

git clone git://github.com/Coornail/Turing-machine-simulator.git
cd Turing-machine-simulator
git submodule init
git submodule update

Todo:
* Check for duplicate rules
* Indicate the rule that is executed
* Show steps in a "history" view
* Auto stepping
* Description
* Terminology fix
* Better design
* turing_ui event-binder refactor to smaller functions

Just so you know for which to send pull requests =)
